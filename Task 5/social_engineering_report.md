Social Engineering Attacks: Brief Report

Overview
Social engineering tricks people gain access, steal data, or trigger payments. Attackers lean on trust, urgency, fear, curiosity, and authority across email, phone, SMS, social platforms, and even face‑to‑face interactions. These scams often kick off bigger incidents like BEC, ransomware, or account takeover.

Main Attack Types
- Phishing: Fake emails or messages that push clicks, downloads, or credential entry.
- Spear Phishing/Whaling: Targeted phishing at specific staff or executives.
- Pretexting: Pretending to be IT, a vendor, or a bank to justify sensitive requests.
- Baiting: Enticing items (USBs, “free” downloads) that install malware or steal data.
- Smishing/Vishing: SMS and phone variants of phishing.
- BEC: Using real or spoofed business email to reroute payments.
- Tailgating: Following someone into restricted areas.
- Quid Pro Quo/Honeytrap: Offering help or fake relationships to extract info.
- Watering Hole/Diversion: Booby‑trapping sites targets visit or rerouting deliveries.

Real Incidents and Impact
- Large wire frauds happened when finance teams were tricked into changing bank details or rushing urgent transfers.
- Executive impersonation, including deepfake voice, pushed unverified payments.
- Credential phishing led to inbox takeovers, data leaks, and ransomware footholds.
Common fallout: financial loss, downtime, response costs, compliance exposure, and brand damage.

How These Succeed
- Authority/Urgency: “Boss” or “regulator” demands immediate action.
- Trust/Familiarity: Lookalike domains and internal spoofs build credibility.
- Curiosity/Greed/Helpfulness: Rewards, USB drops, or “IT support” prompts cooperation.

Prevention and Mitigation
- Culture & Training: Regular awareness sessions and phishing drills; verify unusual requests via a second channel; easy, no‑blame reporting.
- Identity & Access: MFA (preferably phishing‑resistant keys), least privilege, separate admin roles.
- Email/Web/Endpoint: SPF/DKIM/DMARC, link/file sandboxing, DNS/web filtering, EDR/XDR, DLP, restrict USB autorun.
- Processes: Dual approval for big payments; strict vendor bank‑change checks with callbacks to known numbers; documented playbooks.
- Monitoring & Recovery: Red‑team tests, fast takedown and account recovery steps, watch for suspicious forwarding rules, OAuth grants, and impossible travel.

Most breaches start with human manipulation. Build verification habits, lock down money and access with strong processes, and layer technical controls to limit damage if a slip happens.
